In this study, we analyzed 1,550 NSCLC patient samples and identified 52 tRDFs across four subtypes. Six tRDFs were selected as diagnostic signatures based on expression patterns, achieving AUC up to 0.90 in independent validations. Two signatures were successfully validated in plasma samples, and six signatures showed consistent differential expression in NSCLC cell lines. Ten tRDFs, together with stage-specific risk scores, predicted survival outcomes; 5a_tRF-Ile-AAT/GAT may serve as an early-stage prognostic biomarker. Association analyses suggested that correlated mRNAs and targeted miRNAs were enriched in cell cycle and oocyte meiosis pathways. Five tRDFs were associated with PD-L1 immune checkpoint signatures and genes involved in PD-L1 signaling. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive tRDF atlas in lung cancer and supports tRDFs as diagnostic, prognostic, and immunotherapy-relevant biomarkers.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/tRDF/tsRNA_common_Page_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/tRDF/tsRNA_common_Page_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/tRDF/tsRNA_common_Page_1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/tRDF/tsRNA_common_Page_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" alt="Overview figure summarizing common tRDFs across datasets" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <hr> <h2 id="differentially-expressed-trdfs-in-tumor-vs-normal-samples">Differentially expressed tRDFs in tumor vs normal samples</h2> <p><strong>Highlight:</strong> 11 common DE tRDFs replicated across GEO datasets; external validations reach AUC 0.914 and 0.905.</p> <p>(A and B) Heatmaps show DE tRDFs in two GEO datasets with paired tumor and normal samples.
